# CI/CD for Machine Learning Pipelines

## What is CI/CD in ML?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.

In ML systems, CI/CD ensures that:
- Code changes are tested automatically
- Data validation runs on every change
- Broken pipelines never reach production

Unlike traditional software, ML CI/CD must validate:
- Code
- Data
- Models
